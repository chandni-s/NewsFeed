(commit e60a154ce4a541f44dc7b2fc6283287c0f9c53bf, branch Master)

== CORRECTNESS ==

The server seems to run and user interaction doesn't seem to crash the
server.

Interactions appear to do the correct thing as the result immediately shows
on screen - add source, add article, etc.

== DOCUMENTATION ==

The Response class is used throughout but no indication of how Response class
is used is at all present in the document.  Lines 20-21 provide some insight 
on why the Response class is being used, but does not provide how it is used.

Similarly, Request is used everywhere, but is not explained.

In particular, lines 92, 94, 109, 111-114, 124, 126 all return
Response objects, but it is not obvious as to how Response could be used.

Line 342: It is not immediately obvious as to what TldDomainNotFound, TldBadUrl
exceptions are, and no comments indicate this.

Similarly, line 375 is not an obvious exception handle.

Docstrings seem to correspond and explain what the functions do.

== CODING STYLE ==

Variable names and function names make sense.  

There do not seem to be redundant variables.  

In particular, there is a good use of initializing objects when returning them
instead of creating a variable for the object and then returning it.  For 
example, lines 109 and 111 all return a Response object and is returned as 
soon as it is initialized.   

== CODING GUIDELINES ==

The project follows PEP8. No PEP8 errors appeared in the code.

Some variable names overshadow some names that have been defined already by
the standard library.  In particular lines: 134, 136, 160, 162, 328, 329, 330, 
333, 362 are all examples of where the variable name "id" is used when "id" is 
used already.

== TESTING ==

The various user interactions can be tested through manual testing - testing
different situations, such as attempting to add invalid items.

For example,
1.  Testing when the article is added, but the source has not been added yet.
2.  Testing when the article is added, but the source has been added already.
etc.

== SUMMARY ==

More documentation and comments should be provided.  In particular, some 
information as to how Request and Response could be placed within the preface.
