a) Correctness:
Upon reading this code, I was able to understand this code logically.
It implements what is required and code is written bug free. All the 
components that are implemented works fine, however there exists one 
function that is missing implementation at line:231


b) Coding style
- Consistent
- Code does not follow Pep8 - have extra white spaces and over 80
	characters in some line
- Need to use more white space to help understand code more easily 


c) Coding guidelines
- Follows coding guidelines as expected 
- Have enough comments and doc-strings to facilitate understanding of code easily
- Good use of naming conventions
- Few variables needs better naming such as line:93 


d) Documentation
- line:81 - should be "Not" instead of "Nor"
- the link or relationship between 'tweet' and 'article' needs more 
	explanation. for ex: line:81 is trying to get tweet but comment in 
	line:83 is talking about article
- better, meaningful variable instead of 'b' could be used in line:93
- unnecessary print statement on line:97, 127, 139, 142, 211, 215  - if its 
	for testing purposes, it should be removed
- Comments are too long in line:135-137
- unnecessary commented-out code at line:251, 259

e) Testing
- A thorough test case has been written in Main, which appears to test 
	thoroughly; however a separate unit test case file is needed to follow
	PyUnit testing format 

f) Summary
Overall, the code written makes sense logically. It appears bug free and intends to do
what's expected. Increase in use of white space is highly recommended; over use of 
unnecessary print statements is cluttering the code. The file needs to have separate test
file to test it thoroughly by following the PyUnit test case guidelines. 
But overall, the code works as expected and performs what's intended.
