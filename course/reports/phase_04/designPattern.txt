Our system follows singleton design pattern throughout. Singleton
design pattern occurs when the instantiation of a class has been restricted
to one object. Such a class that uses this design in our system would be the
Database class.

The Server ensures that all classes that require Database would be able to 
access this class.  For example, Server will be able to pass Database as a
reference to NetworkVisual, Plot2D, or web to the functions that need it.

Furthermore, there should be only ever one instance of Database inside the
application; Server, at the beginning of run-time, will create only one
instance of Database and there is no way to create another instance of it
through any function call.

Similar notions can be said about Server.
