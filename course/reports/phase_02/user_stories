User Stories
Preface
Throughout the document, there is frequent use of key concepts that the clients 
want, and the software will work with. For clarity, they are defined below:
- Source: A publisher of news media. Media can come in many forms - text, audio, 
video, but media is not limited to just these examples. A source could be a 
website, a blog, a Twitter account, a YouTube channel, or many other existing and
emerging forms.
- Keyword: A word or phrase associated with a source. For example, the 
"Associated Press" is often referred to as "AP", and these are both keywords for
the same source. The URL of the main page of a news article website could also be
used as a Keyword to match sources from references.
- Article: A news piece published by a source. Since sources publish many different
forms of media, this could be an article on a website, a blog post, a Twitter 
discussion, a video, a podcast, or anything else on the internet.
- Tags: Information associated with an article - such as author, date, number of
hits, etc [This will evolve as requirements for data formats and visualizations 
evolve.
- Link: A connection formed when an article cites an article from another source 
directly. The connection is between two articles.
- Reference: A connection formed when an article cites a source, either by citing
an article from another source, or the name of the source. The connection is from 
an article to another source.  References may not imply a link, as not all references
(such as quotations) may not contain a link.
- Visualization: A representation of stored data in the software. Lists, tables, 
graphs, plots, pie charts, are a few examples of visualizations.

The cost model will be explained in the release plan.
Priorities are defined as following: 10 being the highest, and 1 being the lowest.
