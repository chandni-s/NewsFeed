In the current iteration, the focus was on the user stories marked for completion. In sync with it, all of the
user stories, save two, were completed.

These are as follows:

1.  Category sorting

2.  Reference searching -
This was split up into two user stories (with the first being completed in Iteration one)

The new user stories include:

a. Watch list of articles (and potentially sources)
b. Data export (WARC)

 
Additional fixes, (owing to the interview feedback) include:

1.  Database error handling - (making the error messages more specific) 

2.  Enhancing the UI intutiveness 

3.  Making the data entry easier


Fix Number 2 can be implemented via the user story:

a.  As John (a researcher), I want to add a source into the application by specifying the url, so that I may track 
articles from that source.


Other user stories being worked on:

1.  The second part of the reference searching user story 

2.  Visualizations:

      -Creation of a function to generate Network Visualizations

      -Plot visualizations

 
The functions in the database have been updated. These include the functions that had been completed in the previous 
iteration.

The UI is being contructed to support the above. The focus is also on developing the visualizations.
