== Cost ==
Unit cost - one member of the team working on the project for a day.

We have 5 members, so in a day, we have 5 units of work that can be completed.
But we are not working every day in the week, so we expect to only have 2 days of the week to work on the project.

For example, in one week,
5 units per day * 2 days per week = 10 units of work per week

===========
Iteration 1 (2 weeks) - Release Date: 15/10/2014

The main functionalities needed by the business are implemented during this iteration - 
searching for references to sources inside an article and keeping a list of references
that are made inside articles.

Furthermore, other important functionalities are implemented during this iteration:
Keeping track of a list of sources, articles, and keywords. Moreover, adding these
to the system.
