      State of the Project
Are we following the current state of the project?
What are the changes made to the state?
Why/why not were the changes made?
What elements from the previous phase are we building on?
In the current iteration, the focus was on the user stories marked for completion. In sync with it, all of the user stories, save two, were completed.
These are as follows:
      1.  Category sorting
      2.  Reference searching -
This was split up into two user stories (with the first being completed in Iteration one)
The new user stories include:
      a. Watch list of articles (and potentially sources)
      b. Data export 
Additional fixes, (owing to the interview feedback) include:
1.  Database error handling - (making the error messages more specific) 
      2.  Enhancing the UI intuitiveness 
      3.  Making the data entry easier
Fix Number 2 can be implemented via the user story:
a. As John (a researcher), I want to add a source into the application by specifying the url, so that I may track articles from that source.
Other user stories being worked on:
      1.  The second part of the reference searching user story 
      2.  Visualizations:
      -Creation of a function to generate Network Visualizations
      -Plot visualizations
The functions in the database have been updated. These include the functions that had been completed in the previous iteration.
The UI is being constructed to support the above. The focus is also on developing the visualizations.





















      
      Updated Plans
      
The updated release plan for the current iteration is as follows:
== Cost ==
Unit cost – refers to one member of the team working on the project for a day.
We have 5 members, so in a day, we have 5 units of work that can be completed. But we are not working every day in the week, so we can expect to only have 2 days of the week to work on the project.
For example, in a given week:
 5 units per day * 2 days per week = 10 units of work per week

===========
Iteration 1 (2 weeks) - Release Date: 15/10/2014
This iteration takes into account the implementation of the essential functionalities needed by the business. These include:
* The search for references to sources within an article and then retaining a list of references that are made inside articles.
This iteration also focuses on the implementation of:
* Keeping track of a list of sources, articles, and keywords.
* Adding the list of sources, articles and keywords to the system.

      Verification
This was done by unit testing, and code reviews. The former are included with our Phase 3 submission. The focus was primarily on unit testing for each of database (including query), web, rss and visualizations. 
The code reviews are listed below. We used a checklist based inspection, taking care to address the elements listed below.
